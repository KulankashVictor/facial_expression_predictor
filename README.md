# Facial_Expression_Predictor
## Overview
This project is aimed at utilizing Nvidia's CUDA cores and the Tensor RT machine learning framework cores to optimize a facial classification machine learning model.
The input for this model is images from a real time video stream and the model is trained and optimized to classify whether an individual is sad, angry, happy or emotionless.
The training data set is in the data folder as well as the validation and test dataset.
